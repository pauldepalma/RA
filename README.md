Python examples for research assistants
There are many, many online resources.  I like to have a book.
Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python3 (Charles Severence) is < $10 on Amazon.

Python3 is installed on the virtual machine. 
The editor for Python is idle.   I bring up up on my VM by typing: idle-python3.7
If this doesn't work, try variations: idle-python, idle-python3, etc.   
Don't use Python2.7.  That version is no longer supported.

You can also use any conventional editor.  If you do that, execute your programs 
from the command line like this:

csuser>python3 mypgm.py
