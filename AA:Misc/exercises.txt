Exercise 1:
    Write a program that asks the user for a Celsius temperature and
    converts it to Faherheit

Exercise 2:
    Write a programs that, after asking the user for input, either converts
    Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius.
    The program has at least two functions:
        FtoC
        CtoF

Exercise 3:
    Extend exercise 2 so that after the program has done a conversion asks the
    user if he/she would like another conversion? 'Y' means do it again.
    'N' means quit

Exercise 4:
    Write a program that:
        1. Asks the user for two integers a an b, where a >= 2, a < b
        2. Generates all prime numbers in the range [a...b]
