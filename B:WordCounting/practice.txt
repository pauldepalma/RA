Task: Use a dictionary to count the words in George Eliot's Middlemarch

Technique:
    Every distinct word (called a "type" in linguistics) is a key.
    The associated value is the number of times it appears in the text
    Everything you need to make this work is illustrated in the examples,
    but especially ex1.py and ex2.py




A. Find Middlemarch among the files in this directory

B.  Using ex2.py as a model, tokenize the file by removing all punctuation
    and end of line characters. 

C. Using a dictionary, count and display the number of word types in Middlemarch.
