Task: Use a dictionary to count the words in George Eliot's Middlemarch

Technique:
    Every distinct word (called a "type" in linguistics) is a key.
    The associated value is the number of times it appears in the text
    Everything you need to make this work is illustrated in the examples,
    but especially ex5.py and ex6.py




A. Get Middlemarch
    1. Go to https://www.gutenberg.org
    2. Search for Middlemarch
    3. Download the file 145-0-zip.  On a mac this will get unzipped to
        145-0.txt.
    4. Put this in vm-share.  George Eliot's Middlemarch is now on your virtual
       machine

B.  Using ex6.py as a model, tokenize the file by removing all punctuation
    and end of line characters. 

C. Using a dictionary, count and display the number of word types in Middlemarch.
