Task: Count the number unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and quadgrams in Middlemarch

A.  Learn a bit about N-Grams
    1. Click on CPSC 475 on my website (www.cs.gonzaga.edu/depalma)
    2. Click on the Lectures Link
    3. Click on 3-1:Language Modeling with N-Grams 
    3. Read slides 1 thorugh 8
    4. Here is an N-gram example:
        Higgledy Piggledy, my black hen.
        She lays eggs for gentlemen.

        The unigrams are the individual words.
        The bigrams are: {Higgledy Piggledy}, {Piggledy my}, {my, black} ...
        The trigram are: {Higgledy Piggledy my}, {Piggledy my black},
            {my black hen} ...
        The quadgrams are: {Higgledy Piggledy my black}, {Piggledy my black hen},
            {my black hen she} ...
    
B. Tokenize Middlemarch
    1. Read Middlemarch into a string

    2. Delete all lines up to, but not including "Prelude.", the line that
    starts the text.

    3. Remove all characters except upper and lower case alphabetic characters
    and spaces, using the regex commands you've already used.

    4. Transform all upper case characters to lower case characters

C.  Using the same technique you used to count words in Middlemarch,
    count unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams in Moby Dick text from NLTK

D.  I'm pretty sure there are functions within NLTK to count grams.  Use them
    to count the four gram types in Moby Dick.  Compare your numbers from C
    with the numbers you've gotten using NLTK.
