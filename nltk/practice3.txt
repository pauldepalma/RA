Tasks
1. Install idle, the IDE for Python (if you have not already done this):
2. Install the Natural Language Processing Took Kit (nltk)
3. Write your own version of NLTK functions 

Part 1. Install idle
Type at the command line: sudo apt-install idle-python3.7

Part 2 
To install nltk for the virtual machine, 
  Type at the command line: pip3 install nltk

Test that the installation was successful: 
  Type at the command line: python3
  Type at python prompt: import nltk
  Quit python: quit()

Access the nltk corpora
  Type at the command line: python3
  At the python prompt, type: nltk.download()
     choose 'book'
  Quit python: quit()

See what corpora are available:
  Type at the command line: python3 ex7.py

Display sentences in Moby Dick with a given word:
  Type at the command line: python3 ex8.py

Part 3
You noticed that the sentences were not displayed very well.
Write a program, paractice3.py, that:


Part 3
You noticed that the sentences were not displayed very well.
Write a program, paractice3.py, using idle that:
1. Opens and reads the file, melvell-moby_dick.txt
2. Splits it into a list of sentences by writing your own function in place of 'gutenberg.sents'
3. Asks the user to input a word then:
   Displays how many times that word is found in Moby Dick
   Displays the sentences containing that word, but more beautifully than NLTK displays them:
   --Capitalize the first word.
   --Remove the initial space before commas and semi-colons
   --Separate sentences by a blank line
   --Do whatever else is necessay to make the displayed sentence look like a sentence in a book.
