Tasks
1. Install the Natural Language Processing Took Kit (nltk)
2. Write your own version of NLTK functions 

Part 1 
To install nltk for the virtual machine, 
  Type at the command line: pip3 install nltk

Test that the installation was successful: 
  Type at the command line: python3
  Type at python prompt: import nltk
  Quit python: quit()

Access the nltk corpora
  Type at the command line: python3
  At the python prompt, type: nltk.download()
     choose 'book'
  Quit python: quit()

See what corpora are available:
  Type at the command line: python3 ex7.py

Display sentences in Moby Dick with a given word:
  Type at the command line: python3 ex8.py

Part 2 
You noticed that the sentences were not displayed nicely.
Write a program, paractice3.py, using idle that:
1. Opens and reads the file, melville-moby_dick.txt
2. Splits it into a list of sentences by writing your own function in place of 'gutenberg.sents'
3. Write one or functions that: 
   Asks the user to input a word
   Displays how many times that word is found in Moby Dick
   Displays the sentences containing that word, but more beautifully than NLTK displays them:
   --Capitalize the first word
   --Remove the initial space before commas and semi-colons
   --Separate sentences by a blank line
   --Do whatever else is necessay to make the displayed sentence look like a sentence in a book.
