Below are specs for two programs.
Be sure to test your work by running on small files that you can count by hand. 

A. Write a program, make_grams.py, that will:
1. read a text file whose name is gotten from the command line
2. generate grams whose type (bi, tri, quad) is gotten from the command line
3. Counts the frequency of occurence
4. Generates a file with two columns, bigram followed by frequency 

Example:

higgldy piggledy my black my black higgledy piggledy becomes:

higgledy piggledy 2
my black 2
higgldy piggledy 1
piggledy my 1
black my 1
black higgledy 1

5. Create an output file name by concatenating the input file name with the type of gram 

Example: 
input file: buckeye.txt
Output file: buckeye_bi.txt

6.Example command line input: python3 make_grams buckeye.txt bi

B. Write a second program, make_all_grams.py, that:

1.  Reads all of the grams files in the current directory.

2. Creates a an output file like the above, though this time all the grams are sorted by frequency 
and written out in reverse order

Example: An output file for some set of grams might look like this: 

these are the days 12475
these are 12474
these were 4534
hello there Ayla 484
...

The output file is all_grams_out.txt
