Ayla,

These three files are each json strings which, when, uploaded will become strings in your python program.

If you don't know now to read a JSON files, you will find examples of this, by cloning my CPSC222 GitHub repo: clone https://github.com/pauldepalma/CPSC222

Go to the folder ../D-Jypyter-JSON.  You'll find 5-JSON.py which provides a simple example of JSON file I/O (called deserializing/serilzing.  There are more examples in 4-JSON.ipynb.
There are runnable through Jupyter Notebook. Let me know if you'd like me to pythonize these.


Write five functions in a single python program:
Functions one to four will, given a string like the examples, 
create uni,bi,tri,quadgram lists.  Function five will store
them in a python dictionary and write it to a json file.
