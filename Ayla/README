Ayla,

These three files are each json strings which, when, uploaded will become strings in your python program.

If you don't know now to read a JSON files, you will find examples of this, by cloning my CPSC222 GitHub repo: clone https://github.com/pauldepalma/CPSC222

Go to the folder ../D-Jypyter-JSON.  You'll find 5-JSON.py which provides a simple example of JSON file I/O (called deserializing/serilzing.  There are more examples in 4-JSON.ipynb.
There are runnable through Jupyter Notebook. Let me know if you'd like me to pythonize these.

1)
Write five functions in a single python program:
Functions one to four will, given a string like the examples, 
create uni, bi,tri,quadgram lists.  Function five will store
them in a python dictionary and write it to a json file: ngramsAyla.json

Before you go on to Masque and Ulysses, test your program on Test.json.  You can easily generate the grams by hand and compare them to your own work.

2)
The Natural Language Tool Kit (www.nltk.org) provides N-Gram generation and counting libraries.  I'll work up a couple of short examples and push them up to the AYLA folder.  Then, set the libraries to work on the three files. Store the output, as above.  Call the file: ngrarmsNLTL.json

Save the programs in Ayla and push the changes to GitHub.
