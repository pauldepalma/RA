1. Extend what you've for unigrams, bigrams, trigrams to quadgrams and all grams


Task 2, Unigrams
 Make a dictionary such that each key is a word, the value being the number of times it occurs
 {w1:n1,w2:n2,...w_k:n_k}

Task 3, 
 Do task 1 for all other grams.
 Do task 1 for all grams

In the end you'll have a dictionary like this:

{
 unigrams:{words:counts}
 bigrams:{words:counts}
 etc.
}
